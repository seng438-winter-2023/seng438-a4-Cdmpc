# Introduction

This lab extends on the more rigourous and complex world of testing, testing an actual GUI application
with many possible combinations of user interactions and inputs for the system. While also gaining experience on mutant testing
such that when we insert bugs into the program, the tests should fail and not ignore the faults.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Because coverage metrics only determine if the functions enter the branches based on conditions and checks only whether the lines
of code are executed regardless of logical correctness.
But it does not check if the code is logically correct.
It does not check that your tests are actually able to detect faults in the executed code.
It is therefore only able to identify code that is definitely not tested.

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

- Carlos and Hassan handled the mutation testing.
- Neil and Toshi handled the GUI testing part.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
